# Currency Converter

## Description

### Features:

### Background

Currency Converter is a React App I made out of the purpose of code practising while I'm working full time as a software developer. All the functions are realized out of simple React components and hooks. The UI of this app has used plenty of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), which is a helpful UI library that saves me a lot of headache on UI design. 

All the data of this app is from [The Free Currency Converter API](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/). It offers nice and generous api service allowing 100 calls per hours with no charge. However, as stated in its documents, it offers no waranty on the accuracy. And as requested, the detailed licence is as below:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
